# ITIS_4440_Crypto_Currency_Exchange
This is a basic interactive crypto-currency exchange web application. The application facilitates user to buy sell multiple cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum). We use CryptoCompareâ€™s API to get real-time data. To initiate the transactions, the application asks the user to setup their virtual wallet with an initial amount of money for performing the transaction. The user can see and compare the historical and current prices of different cryptocurrencies in US dollars, using interactive graph elements created using Victory. The application provides the functionality to setup limits on accounts to secure the transaction. The application has voice I/O functionality to search for current currency conversion rates, and also convert a user-provided amount of one currency to the equivalent amount in another currency.
